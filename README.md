## Project Description
This project is an online resume created with HTML. It covers various aspects of my background, including a summary, education, work experience, skills, and achievements.

## Project Requirements
To meet the project requirements:
- I created an HTML file named `index.html`.
- The HTML document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
- The `<head>` section includes a `<title>` element with the text "My Resume."
- Inside the `<body>` section, I used appropriate HTML tags to format the content for each section.
- I included a profile photo and used anchor tags to create a multi-page website, listing additional resume aspects like Hobbies and Contact details.
- I added a `<footer>` element with my name and copyright information.
